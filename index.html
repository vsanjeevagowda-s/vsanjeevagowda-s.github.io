						<h3>About</h3>
						Streets are the lifeline of a city – like veins running across leaves, they criss-cross a city giving it
						shape and character. The life and stories on its streets are a password to the character of a city ...
						its essence, culture, history, architecture, food and its issues. The best way to get to know a city is
						to walk around its lanes and by-lanes and explore its streets. BLR Street is an attempt to capture
						the life and times of the streets of cities across the world, starting with India.
						Local food, especially street food and popular local eateries are perhaps the best gastronomical
						introduction to a city – its ingredients, flavours and spices are the easiest way to get under the skin
						or umm ... into the stomach of a city. However, discovering the best local places to eat in a city is
						best done with a foodie friend who knows the small nooks and joints that serve exceptionally good
						food. That is the inspiration behind BLR Street. To be that local foodie friend who helps travelers
						find the best of local and street food, the joints where food and conversation flow and the cultural
						nuances of the city come the fore.
						The joints we cover include the hole-in-the-wall local eateries that are difficult to spot, famous
						street food vendors and small, cozy cafes that serve as a perfect meeting spot for adda sessions,
						quick bites, refreshing chai, addictive coffee and superb snack food.
						The best local eateries in each city is what Talking Street will talk to you about, peppered with
						posts about the vendors, stall-owners, peddlers and pavement dwellers. Happy listening!
						P.S. Here’s a perfect introduction to us, courtesy Village Talkies.

							<p>Like the area surrounding any college, the streets around Indiranagar are dotted with a variety of
								eateries and street food stalls patronised for good reason by the students whom they serve.
								Here are a few that you could check out:
								Hatti Kaapi – Superlative filter coffee. Best of South-Indian tiffin snacks – Maddur Vada, Masala
								Bun, Vada Pao, Idly, Vada. Hazelnut Cold Coffee.
								Khawa Karpo – Hole-in-the-wall Tibetan joint frequented by students. Thukpa, Honey Potato
								Wedges, Ting-Mo and Chicken Shap-tak.
								Juice Junction – Freshly prepared fruit juices, fruit salad.
								Soori Chats – South-Indian Bhel Puri.</p>
								‘
								<p>String them together to form the Indiranagar. This area is full of eateries of varying budgets. Among
									the mid-range restaurants you could also try Meghana Biryani for Andhra style biryani, Empire
									Restaurant for Dosa Chicken and Truffles Ice and Spice for continental cuisine.</p>

								<div class="vvpuramText" style="display: none;">
									<p>VV Puram is Bangalore’s most famous Food Street and a complete must-do for anyone visiting or
										staying in Bangalore. Till you get there and try the food, you really don’t know what you’re missing.
										This guide attempts to cover almost each of the outlets starting from when one enters the street at
										Sajjan Rao Circle. Before that a few basic guidelines about this food street and what we suggest
										you keep in mind while planning this gastronomical adventure.
									</p>
										<ul class="contentul">
											<li><img src="BLR Street Food sliced assets with content/logo-and-icons/icon-bullet.png" alt="">To taste maximum number of dishes and make the most of this trail, do it in a group of 8 or more
												people (who do not mind sharing food). There is so much on offer that just a couple of bites of
												the top items at each joint will fill you up to a point when the senses may crave but the stomach
												will refuse to take in any more. No point eating one or two items and heading back, we say.
											</li>
												<li><img src="BLR Street Food sliced assets with content/logo-and-icons/icon-bullet.png" alt="">VV Puram comes alive around 7:30 – 8:00 in the evening. While some of the shops start serving
													from 5:30-6:00 PM onwards, all of them are ready only by 7:00 PM.</li>
													<li><img src="BLR Street Food sliced assets with content/logo-and-icons/icon-bullet.png" alt="">Weekends are extremely crowded so get there a little early. The crowds can mean having to wait
														a fair bit of time at some of the shops.</li>
														<li>
														<img src="BLR Street Food sliced assets with content/logo-and-icons/icon-bullet.png" alt="">Finding parking is not extremely easy on weekends – try one of the roads leading into Sajjan Rao
															Circle if you can’t find parking around the circle itself.
															</li>
															<li>
															<img src="BLR Street Food sliced assets with content/logo-and-icons/icon-bullet.png" alt="">Do use dustbins to dispose of the plates etc. Most shops will have dustbins placed at prominent
																locations.
															</li>
																<li>
																<img src="BLR Street Food sliced assets with content/logo-and-icons/icon-bullet.png" alt="">Try and avoid wasting food.</li>
										</ul>
														</div><!--class="vvpuramText"-->

				
				<div class="kormangalaText" style="display: none;">
															<p>Koramangala is another of Bangalore’s hip and happening party and food districts, housing
																restaurants specializing in any cuisine you can think of. It is 4 kms from Royal Orchid down a
																straight road – the intermediate ring road. Koramangala has super interesting street-side joints,
																standing shoulder to shoulder with their more sophisticated, up-market cousins. An interesting
																Rajasthani place, a hole-in-the-wall Tibetian joint, Bhajji Carts, Pao Bhaji vans ... lots to explore in
																this part of the city.</p>
																<p>(Quick advice on the traffic scene. Getting from Royal Orchid to Koramangala can take anywhere
																	from 7 mins to 45 mins – it is a simple function of the time of day and traffic scenario. During office
																	hours (read 8:30 AM – 10:30 AM and 5:30 PM – 7:30 PM) the 45 min time frame is what you
																	should budget for.)</p>
																	<p>It’s worth splitting Koramangala into two sections. The area around Jyoti Nivas College has a
																		buzzing student vibe. Then there is 80 ft Rd Koramangala that has what could be called the
																		Koramangala Food Street for the string of street-side food stalls it hosts. (Koramangala actually
																		had a food street (read about it here) which was relocated by the Municipal authorities a few
																		months ago. There is hope that the authorities will allow the vendors to come back and set up the
																		street the way it was but for now all the vendors have relocated from there.)</p>

																		Now a quick overview of the food before we get into the specifics of what each of the joints serve.
																		There are about 15 outlets serving different types of food (listed below outlet by outlet). We would
																		classify the food varieties into the following categories in decreasing order of specialty – from must-
																		have to do-try to not-what-this-is-known-for. That is not to say that food listed in the last category is
																		not good – it’s just not what this street is known for. Also, some of those in the last category are
																		relatively new additions to this otherwise old food street, and purists that we are, we would like to
																		call them out.</p>
